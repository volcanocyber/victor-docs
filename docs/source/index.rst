Welcome to the VICTOR documentation!
===================================

**VICTOR** is a JupyterHub based platform for volcano science modeling and data analysis.
All of our infrastructure and modeling code is open-source and/or publicly available. We hope for 
VICTOR to function as a continously evolving service, fostering novel mathematical models and encouraging further
data sharing among the volcanology community and beyond.
